    "Background:\n",
    "Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "Data Provided:\n",
    "•\tThe theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X\n",
    "•\tSample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050\n",
    "•\tNumber of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission Guidelines:\n",
    "•\tPrepare python file detailing each step of your hypothesis testing process.\n",
    "•\tInclude calculations for the test statistic and the critical value.\n",
    "•\tProvide a clear conclusion based on your analysis.\n",
